# Nicole Brewer's CV

I'm a long-time fan of @posquit0 's Awesome-CV, but have had issues in the past trying to template it with Pandoc. I'm glad I found [vitae](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/index.html), which has done the hard work for me.

The only downside is that there are several stylistic classes present Awesome-CV that aren't represented in vitae, including @aminmkhan 's fork that extends a publication class.
