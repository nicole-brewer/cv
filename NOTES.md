Notes from Carol:

'A few quick comments on your CV:
 
You didn’t list your degree under education.
 
Experience -> Professional Experience
 
Move “Purdue’s All‐Women StudentC luster Competition Team” at Supercomputing 2018 to under Research Experience?
 
Move “Vice president of purdue Triathlon club” to Service?
 
I would rearrange the order as follows:
 
Education
Training
Professional Experience
Research Experience
Publications
Presentations
Honors and Awards
Teaching Experience
Service'
